Project Description:
When we thought of what it meant to turn a new leaf, we thought about change. Changes to our physical environment, emotional state and wellbeing. As our team thought about significant change, we were reminded of divorce. As children of divorce, our parents' seperation deeply impacted our lives. However, it also marked the beginning of a new stage in our lives: the child of divorce era. Inspired by this, we created a game where the players go through stages of a divorce as they turn over new leaves through repeated clicking. Players click on leaves to turn them over, experiencing the tedious emotions that divorce causes. As they turn over more leaves, players can unlock more mini-games that teach them about getting a divorce and starting a new chapter of their life.
